# bcstats ohcs craigslist
Extractor / parser, written for web-scraped craigslist data as provided to BC Stats, by Harmari Inc.
* [R implementation (Windows/MacOS/Linux compatible)](https://github.com/bcgov/bcstats_ohcs_craigslist/tree/master/R) thanks to Sam Albers for successful deployment verification on Windows
* [python-only implementation (MacOS/Linux compatible)](https://github.com/bcgov/bcstats_ohcs_craigslist/tree/master/py)

**Overview**

Wrangle a large, irregularly formatted, housing-market dataset on an ordinary computer, in a finite amount of time, using some large data / HPC-ish techniques
* out of memory
* parallelism

**The challenge**

The original data incl. an irregularly formatted CSV file (22GB) incl. approx. 1,000,000 HTML files stuffed into a CSV, where each HTML-file attribute, spans approx. 500 lines. Python 3's "import csv" and R's "library{vroom}" couldn't read the data at this time, so custom out-of-memory slice/extract/parse was used. Moreover, Python3's BeautifulSoup html-parsing, was accelerated using full machine parallelism. The data contain sensitive information and will not be posted

**How to produce separate outputs for Apartments (vs Sublets)**
Place only apartments (or sublets) related data input files, in the code directory, to produce a merged output file that contains only apartments (or sublets) related data
